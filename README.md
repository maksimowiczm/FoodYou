### 📌 What is this?

**FoodYou** is a simple calorie-tracking app designed with [Material You](https://m3.material.io/)
aesthetic - at least,
that was the goal! Since I’m still learning, I can’t say for sure if it fully embraces the style. 😅

### ❓ Why does it exist?

I wanted a minimal calorie counter that aligns with Material You, so I decided to build one myself!

### ✨ Features

- **Material You Design**: Dynamic theming for a visually cohesive experience.
- **Interactive Home Page**: Built with cards offering key functionalities.
