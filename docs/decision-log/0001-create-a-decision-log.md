## 1. Create a decision log

Date: 2025-09-25

### Problem

Food You has grown significantly, and with that growth comes an increase in the number of
decisions that need to be made. These decisions can range from technical choices to strategic
directions. However, without a formal way to document these decisions, important context and
rationale can be lost over time.

Example issues that highlight the need for a decision log:

- [#239](https://github.com/maksimowiczm/FoodYou/issues/239)

### Decision

We will create a decision log to document significant decisions made within the organization. This
log will include the following information for each decision:

- **Date**: When the decision was made.
- **Problem**: A description of the problem or context that led to the decision.
- **Decision**: A clear statement of the decision made.
- **Rationale**: The reasoning behind the decision, including any alternatives considered.
- **Consequences**: The expected outcomes or implications of the decision.

### Rationale

- **Transparency**: A decision log provides a clear record of why certain decisions were made, which
  can be useful for collaborators.
- **Future Reference**: It allows future collaborators to understand the context of past decisions,
  helping them make informed choices.
- **Accountability**: Documenting decisions can help hold collaborators accountable for their
  choices and actions.
- **Collaboration**: A shared decision log encourages collaboration and discussion when making
  significant decisions.

### Consequences

- **Maintenance**: The decision log will require regular updates and maintenance to ensure it
  remains relevant and accurate.
